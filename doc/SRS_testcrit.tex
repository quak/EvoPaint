\section{Testing EvoPaint}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to record the testing results for EvoPaint. Abnormalities will be recorded and documented. This document will serve developers as a error sheet.

\subsection{Test Requirements}



\subsubsection{Painting}

\paragraph{1.2.1.1 Introduction/Purpose of feature}
With the painting tool EvoPaint provides an action which can be used to directly take influence onto the evolution. Within this tool the color and the rules for the painted section are adjustable. Also the size of the brush can be changed. There are different painting options. The user mainly paints color and rules at the same time. There also is the option to turn off one of these two to for example just paint the preset color. In this case the rules which are already present at the evolutions screen are saved and just the color of the regarding pictures are changed. On the other side it is also possible just to paint the rules. In this case the colors of the pixels are kept and the rules would be overwritten. The user should also have the possibility to paint into the evolution screen without using any rules.
There should also be a fairy dust option. In the painting case this fills the area beneath the brush with pixel of random color.

\paragraph{1.2.1.2 Stimulus/Response sequence}
By clicking on the paint brush icon located in the toolbox the paint tool is activated.
The user is now able to paint with the mouse (pressed left mouse button) on the evolution screen.

\paragraph{1.2.1.3 Testing results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Color adjustable			:	requirement ok

\end{itemize}





\subsubsection{Move evolutions}

\paragraph{1.2.2.1 Introduction/Purpose of feature}
The move tool provides the user the possibility to move the evolution screen. So it is possible to focus interesting sections of the evolution. It also provides the user a full view of the evolutionary system without restrictions.

\paragraph{1.2.2.2 Stimulus/Response sequence}
